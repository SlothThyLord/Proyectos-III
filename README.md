# Proyectos-III
A short repository containing all custom scripts used for the development of a custom VR rehab app.

The main scripts are contained in all the folders excluding the "old scripts" folder which contains old code from previous environments.
It is kept as a reference and also because it is a great example of how to work with raw OVR Input.
